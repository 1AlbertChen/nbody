# N-Body Simulation

This is an n-body simulation visualizer written using C and Python. It implements [Barnes-Hut Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnes%E2%80%93Hut_simulation) to simultate an open or globular star cluster. This repository is the edited version of a final project I did with my friends Paul Clarke and Matthew Kennedy for a computational physics class at Northwestern University in 2020. The demos you see below only contain 1,000 bodies each. The program can work for up to 100,000 bodies.

## How to Run

To run the simulation, simply run the .sh files for open or globular clusters.

Syetem requirements: 

[GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (In the .sh files it's gcc-7 but you can change that to your version)

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (python3 in the .sh file but you can change that too)

[Linux Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) or Linux
